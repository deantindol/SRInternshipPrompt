# SRInternshipPrompt

I used Python for my solution to the Engineering prompt. I started by importing the pandas library as well as json. I called the json.loads function to convert the json string into a dict to be easily parsed in a nested loop. I then got the names of the teams into a list by grabbing the keys of the dict. Next, I used a nested loop to populate the matrix with the correct number of wins one team had over another. Last, I utilized the pandas library DataFrame to easily put the matrix into a easily printable table and printed it.
