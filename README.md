# SRInternshipPrompt

I used python for my soltuion to the Engineering prompt. I started by importing the pandas library as well as json. I used the json.loads function to convert the json string into a dictionary to be easily parsed in a nested loop. I then got the names of the teams into a list by grabbing the keys of the dictionary. Next, I used a nested loop to populate the matrix with the correct number of wins one team had over another. Last, I used the Pandas library "dataframe" to easily put the matrix into a easily printable table and printed it.
